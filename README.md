# HR_Analytics
I have created this Power BI Report based on HR analytics.

The report is created to get meaningful insights for the HR Team and higher management to take various employee related decisions.

* Used Power Query Editor to clean the data and made it analysis ready.
* Used DAX Measures for in-depth insights.
* Used various visualization tools
